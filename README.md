# TinMan

Systems engineering and robotics — building firmware, operating systems, frameworks, engines, and engineering platforms.

---

## Engineering Scope

I build systems across abstraction layers:

- Embedded control firmware
- Operating systems experimentation
- Robotics software and hardware integration
- Custom rendering engines (Vulkan / OpenGL)
- Application frameworks
- Engineering tools and visualization platforms
- Cross-platform software systems

---

## Platforms

### AISA
Embedded control firmware platform for robotics and autonomous systems.

### TinkOS
Custom operating system project focused on low-level system architecture and experimentation.

### FrameKit
Application development framework for structured, modular, and scalable software systems.

### RadarScape
Multifunctional engineering tool for processing and visualization.  
Includes a custom graphics rendering engine built using Vulkan and OpenGL.

### OneDeck
LifeOS-style application platform focused on structured digital workflows and personal systems.

## Robotics & Fabrication

- Robotic arms
- Quadruped robotic systems
- Hardware/software co-design
- 3D-printed mechanical systems
- Home automation systems

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Build platforms, not just applications.
- Design for modularity and long-term scalability.
- Separate core logic from interface layers.
- Keep systems layered and composable.
- Integrate hardware and software intentionally.
